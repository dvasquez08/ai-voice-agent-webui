# Welcome to the Voice Assistant Project!

## What is this project?

This project is currently in the works. It will mainly be for helping other people build a web interface for their AI Voice Assistant.

## What will this do?

This will be a simple front facing web UI for the users to interact with their voice agent. It is not meant to be a production-ready app, something for a cool project, a starting point for someone who wants to build an app for their AI voice assistant, or simply testing out the functionality of the assistant.

## How will it work?

This will be connected to an n8n workflow for the backend which will be the one interacting with the ElevenLabs agent.

The website will connect to the ElevenLabs widget, which executes the webhook connected to n8n and that will execute the AI Agent, and then it will also respond through the app as well.

## What's going on right now.

This app is just in it's beginning phasees, with the n8n workflow currently in the works of being built, then tested. The front facing UI will be also be built but just the front-end portion.
